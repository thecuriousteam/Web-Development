   1. Makes the element an "inline" element.
   2. Does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

   2. Takes up only as much width as necessary but allows setting a height and width.

   2. The element is not rendered, and the space it would have occupied is collapsed.

   2. Allows easy layout of child elements in a flexible way.

6. grid:

   1. Turns the element into a grid container.
