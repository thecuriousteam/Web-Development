In simple terms, the CSS position property determines how an element is placed on a webpage. It defines the rules for positioning an element in relation to its normal position in the document flow or other elements.

Here are the main values of the position property explained in simple words:

1. Static:
   1. Default position.
   2. Elements appear in the normal flow of the document.

2. Relative:
   1. Positioned relative to its normal position.
   2. Can be moved using top, right, bottom, and left.

3. Absolute:
   1. Taken out of the normal flow.
   2. Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
   3. Doesn't leave space for the element in the normal flow.

4. Fixed:
   1. Taken out of the normal flow.
   2. Positioned relative to the viewport.
   3. Stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

5. Sticky:
   1. Acts like relative until it crosses a specified point during scrolling.
   2. After crossing the point, it becomes fixed and stays in place.
